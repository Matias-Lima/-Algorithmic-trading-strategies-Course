Regime shifts can spoil everything, and a few \\nimportant historical examples will be highlighted.\\nThe choice of a software platform for backtesting is also an important \\nconsideration and needs to be tackled early on. A good choice not only will \\nvastly increase your productivity, it will also allow you to backtest the broad-\\nest possible spectrum of strategies in the broadest variety of asset classes. \\n', '\\n--- Página 20 ---\\n2\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nAnd it will reduce or eliminate the chances of committing the aforemen-\\ntioned pitfalls. We will also explain why the choice of a good backtesting \\nplatform is often tied to the choice of a good automated execution platform: \\noften, the best platform combines both functions.\\n \\n■The Importance of Backtesting\\nBacktesting is the process of feeding historical data to your trading strategy \\nto see how it would have performed. The hope is that its historical perfor-\\nmance tells us what to expect for its future performance. The importance of \\nthis process is obvious if you have developed a strategy from scratch, since \\nyou would certainly want to know how it has performed. But even if you \\nread about a strategy from a publication, and you trust that the author did \\nnot lie about its stated performance, it is still imperative that you indepen-\\ndently backtest the strategy. There are several reasons for this.\\nOften, the profi tability of a strategy depends sensitively on the details \\nof implementation. For example, are the stock orders supposed to be sent \\nas market-on-open orders or as market orders just after the open? Are we \\nsupposed to send in an order for the E-mini Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 \\nfuture just before the 4:00 p.m. stock market closing time, or just before \\nthe 4:15 p.m. futures market closing time? Are we supposed to use the bid \\nor ask price to trigger a trade, or are we supposed to use the last price? All \\nthese details tend to be glossed over in a published article, often justifi ably \\nso lest they distract from the main idea, but they can aff ect the profi tabil-\\nity of a live-traded strategy signifi cantly. The only way to pin down these \\ndetails exactly, so as to implement them in our own automated execution \\nsystem, is to backtest the strategy ourselves. In fact, ideally, our backtest-\\ning program can be transformed into an automated execution program by \\nthe push of a button to ensure the exact implementation of details\n",

      ". As veterans of algorithmic trading will \\nalso agree, the same theoretical strategy can result in spectacular profi ts and \\nabysmal losses, depending on the details of implementation. Hence, in this \\nbook I have lavished attention on the nitty-gritties of backtesting and some-\\ntimes live implementation of these strategies, with discussions of concepts \\nsuch as data-snooping bias, survivorship bias, primary versus consolidated \\nquotes, the venue dependence of currency quotes, the nuances of short-sale \\nconstraints, the construction of futures continuous contracts, and the use of \\nfutures closing versus settlement prices in backtests. We also highlight some \\ninstances of “regime shift” historically when even the most correct backtest \\nwill fail to predict the future returns of a strategy.\\nI have also paid attention to choosing the right software platform for \\nbacktesting and automated execution, given that MATLAB©, my favorite \\nlanguage, is no longer the only contender in this department. I will survey \\nthe state of the art in technology, for every level of programming skills, and \\nfor many diff erent budgets. In particular, we draw attention to the “inte-\\ngrated development environment” for traders, ranging from the industrial-\\nstrength platforms such as Deltix to the myriad open-source versions such \\nas TradeLink. As we will explain, the ease of switching from backtesting \\nto live trading mode is the most important virtue of such platforms. The \\nfashionable concept of “complex event processing” will also be introduced \\nin this context.\\nI covered risk and money management in my previous book, which was \\nbuilt on the Kelly formula—a formula that determines the optimal lever-\\nage and capital allocation while balancing returns versus risks. I once again \\ncover risk and money management here, still based on the Kelly formula, \\nbut tempered with my practical experience in risk management involving \\nblack swans, constant proportion portfolio insurance, and stop losses. (U.S. \\nSupreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson could have been talking about \\nthe application of the Kelly formula when he said we should “temper its doc-\\ntrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom.”) We especially focus on fi nding \\nthe optimal leverage in realistic situations when we can no longer assume \\nGaussian distribution of returns. Also, we consider whether “risk indicators” \\nmight be a useful component of a comprehensive risk management scheme\n",

      ". In science, we form a hypothesis, express it \\nas a quantitative model, and then test it against new, unseen data to see if \\nthe model is predictive. If the model failed with certain data, we try to fi nd \\nout the reasons for the failures, perhaps add certain variables to the model, \\nand try again. This is a very similar process to how we should approach \\nalgorithmic trading. Recall the ETF pair GLD versus GDX that stopped \\n', '\\n--- Página 206 ---\\n188\\nCONCLUSION\\ncointegrating in 2008 (see Chapter 4). A hypothesis was formed that had \\nto do with the high crude oil price. When oil price was added to the input \\nvariables, the cointegration model started to work again. This scientifi c pro-\\ncess is most helpful when a strategy underperforms the backtest, and we \\nwanted to know why. Instead of blindly adding more rules, more indicators, \\nto the model and hoping that they miraculously improve the model perfor-\\nmance, we should look for a fundamental reason and then quantitatively test \\nwhether this fundamental reason is valid.\\nDespite the eff orts to make the trading process scientifi c and rule based, \\nthere are still areas where subjective judgment is important. For example, \\nwhen there is a major event looming, do you trust that your model will be-\\nhave as your backtest predicted, or do you lower your leverage or even tem-\\nporarily shut down the model in anticipation? Another example is off ered \\nby the application of the Kelly formula to a portfolio of strategies. Should \\nwe allocate capital among these strategies based on the equity of the whole \\nportfolio, so that the good performance of some strategies is subsidizing \\nthe poor performance of others in the short term? Or should we apply the \\nKelly formula to each strategy on its own, so that we quickly deleverage \\nthose strategies that perform poorly recently? Mathematics tells us that the \\nformer solution is optimal, but that’s assuming the expected returns and \\nvolatilities of the strategies are unchanging. Can one really say that such ex-\\npectations are unchanged given a recent period of severe drawdown?\\n(On the fi rst judgment call, my experience has been that if your model \\nhas survived the backtest during prior stressful periods, there is no reason \\nto lower its leverage in the face of coming crisis. It is much better to start off  \\nwith a more conservative leverage during good times than to have to lower \\nit in bad ones\n",
